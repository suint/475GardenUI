# 475GardenUI

Front end of Aloe-Ha: Web Edition
Aloe-Ha is a web application that allows users to build a plot of their garden using suggested native plants from the Delaware area. 

Users can select plants already planted in their gardens:

Then they can enter information about their garden's conditions:

Aloe-Ha will recommend plants based on your garden's conditions as well as when you want your garden to flower/in what color:

On the build page, users can arrange plants in their garden along with various objects:

Then, the app will let you view your schematic in top-down mode, along with information about the plants you've added.

You can also see it from a window view:
